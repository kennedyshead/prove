# Roadmap

## Versioning

Features use status labels rather than version numbers:

- **Preview** — Implemented but may change.
- **Proposed** — Designed, not yet built.
- **Exploring** — Idea stage, no commitment.

Two milestones frame the overall project:

- **V1.0** — Fully featured Python compiler. All language features implemented,
  comprehensive standard library, complete tooling. The reference implementation.
- **V2.0** — Self-hosted compiler written in Prove, compiled by the V1.0 bootstrap.

V1.0 ships when the language is mature. V2.0 planning begins after.

## Preview

### AI-Resistance Enforcement

Parsing, domain profiles (W340-W342), temporal ordering (W390), and invariant
network constraints (E396, W391) are all active. Remaining:

- Counterfactual annotations (`why_not`/`chosen`) — parsed but no semantic checking beyond W503-W505
- Formal invariant network verification — validated syntactically, not proven

## Proposed

## Exploring

The items below build toward Prove's [vision](vision.md) of local, self-contained development — where the project's own declarations drive code generation without external services.

### Row Polymorphism

Structural subtyping for record types.

### `par_map` Concurrency

Runtime scaffolding exists but is not callable from user code.

### Verification Chain Propagation

Per-call-site warnings for unverified `ensures` chains.

### Formal `know` Proofs

General proof beyond the current lightweight `ClaimProver`.

### Self-Hosted Compiler (V2.0)

Rewrite the compiler in Prove. The V1.0 Python bootstrap compiles it,
the resulting binary recompiles itself, and both outputs must match.

## Ecosystem

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [tree-sitter-prove](https://code.botwork.se/Botwork/tree-sitter-prove) | Tree-sitter grammar for editor syntax highlighting |
| [pygments-prove](https://code.botwork.se/Botwork/pygments-prove) | Pygments lexer for MkDocs and Sphinx code rendering |
| [chroma-lexer-prove](https://code.botwork.se/Botwork/chroma-lexer-prove) | Chroma lexer for Gitea and Hugo code rendering |

The `scripts/export-lexers.py` script keeps all three lexer projects in sync
with the compiler's canonical keyword lists automatically.
