TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. GRANT OF RIGHTS

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software, associated documentation files, binary representations, and
companion artifacts (collectively, the "Software"), to deal in the Software
without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy,
modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the
Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,
subject to the conditions below.

2. NOTICE REQUIREMENT

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.

3. AI AND MACHINE LEARNING RESTRICTIONS

3.1. NO TRAINING USE. The Software and any modifications, derivatives,
compiled outputs, or artifacts generated from it may not be used, in whole or
in part, for the purpose of training, improving, fine-tuning, distilling, or
otherwise developing machine learning models, artificial intelligence systems,
neural networks, large language models, code generation tools, natural
language processing systems, or any similar algorithmic systems (collectively,
"AI Systems").

3.2. NO DATASET INCLUSION. The Software may not be included in, indexed by, or
used to construct any dataset, corpus, database, vector store, embedding
index, or retrieval system intended for use by or in connection with AI
Systems. This includes but is not limited to training datasets, evaluation
benchmarks, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) knowledge bases, and code
search indices used to inform AI-generated output.

3.3. NO SYNTHETIC DERIVATION. AI Systems may not be used to generate synthetic
data, code, documentation, or any other artifacts derived from, modeled on, or
informed by the Software.

3.4. NO SUBLICENSING FOR AI USE. Recipients of the Software may not grant any
third party the right to use the Software in any manner prohibited by Sections
3.1 through 3.3, whether through sublicensing, redistribution, service
provision, or any other means.

3.5. DOWNSTREAM PROPAGATION. Any person who redistributes the Software or
derivative works thereof must include these AI and Machine Learning
Restrictions (Section 3 in its entirety) as an enforceable provision in any
license, contract, or terms of service governing such redistribution. Failure
to propagate these restrictions constitutes a breach of this License.

3.6. BREACH. Any usage of the Software in violation of Sections 3.1 through
3.5 constitutes a breach of this License and immediately terminates all rights
granted herein to the breaching party.

4. TECHNICAL PROTECTION MEASURES

The Software may employ technical measures including but not limited to binary
source formats, semantic normalization, source fragmentation, and
cryptographic signatures to protect against unauthorized use as AI training
data. Circumvention of these measures for purposes prohibited by Section 3 is
a breach of this License.

5. PERMITTED AI INTERACTIONS

For avoidance of doubt, the following are NOT prohibited by this License:

5.1. Using AI tools as part of a development workflow to write, review, or
debug Prove source code, provided the Prove source code itself is not used to
train those AI tools.

5.2. Using the Software to build applications that interact with or deploy AI
Systems, provided the Software itself is not used as training data for those
systems.

5.3. Academic research analyzing the Software's design, including publication
of findings, provided such research does not involve training AI Systems on
the Software.

6. DISCLAIMER

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
