# v0.4.2 — Documentation Update

## Context

v0.4 added pure verbs, binary types, namespaced calls, and channel dispatch.
v0.4.1 archived the ASM backend (462 -> 394 tests). Documentation hadn't
caught up: README listed only 4 of 8 CLI commands, error codes E360-E364/E394
were undocumented, the only stdlib module (InputOutput) had no user-facing
reference, and there was no roadmap. CLAUDE.md still said 462 tests and
mislabeled v0.5.

---

## Phase 1: README.md

### 1A — Expand Commands section

Added `format`, `lint`, `view`, `lsp` and surfaced `--md`/`--check` flags.

### 1B — Add verb enforcement errors to Diagnostic Codes

Replaced the existing `### Errors (block compilation)` subsection with a
full error table covering E360-E364 and E390-E394 in numeric order.

### 1C — Add Standard Library section

New section documenting InputOutput — the only shipped stdlib module,
with verb/channel/signature table.

### 1D — Add Roadmap section

Table with v0.1-v1.0 and their status (complete/archived/planned).

---

## Phase 2: CLAUDE.md

### 2A — Fix test count: `462` -> `394`

### 2B — Fix v0.5 description

Updated from "v0.5 (stdlib modules), then v1.0 (self-hosting)" to
"v0.5 (turbo runtime), then v0.6 (core stdlib), v0.7 (IO + Parse), v1.0 (self-hosting)".

### 2C — Expand Diagnostic Codes section

Split into two subsections: verb enforcement (checker.py) with E360-E364,
and proof verification (prover.py) with E390-E394. Kept warnings as-is.

### 2D — Add missing commands

Added `format`, `lint`, `view`, `lsp` with their flags.

---

## Phase 3: 1.0-PLAN.md

Updated ASM backend row: path from `asm_*.py` to `archive/asm/`,
note "Archived in v0.4.1".

---

## Phase 4: MEMORY.md

Updated test count from 462 to 394.

---

## Verification

1. `ruff check src/ tests/` — still clean (no source changes)
2. Visual review of rendered markdown
